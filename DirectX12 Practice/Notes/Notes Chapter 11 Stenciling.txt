The stencil buffer is an off-screen buffer we can use to achieve some special effects. The stencil buffer has the same
resolution as the back buffer and depth buffer, such that the ijth pixel in the stencil buffer corresponds with the ijth pixel
in the back buffer and depth buffer.

For instance, when implementing a mirror, we need to reflect an object across the plane of the mirror; however, we only want
to draw the reflection into the mirror. We can use the stencil buffer to block the rendering of the reflection unless it is
being drawn into the mirror.

The stencil buffer (and also the depth buffer) state is configured by filling out a D3D12_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC instance and
assigning it to the D3D12_GRAPHICS_PIPELINE_STATE_DESC::DepthStencilState field of a pipeline state object (PSO).

For example in Figure 11.1, (Left) The reflected skull shows properly in the mirror. The reflection does not show through the
wall bricks because it fails the depth test in this area. However, looking behind the wall we are able to see the reflection,
thus breaking the illusion (the reflection should only show up through the mirror). (Right) By using the stencil buffer, we can
block the reflected skull from being rendered unless it is being drawn in the mirror.

Recalling that the depth/stencil buffer is a texture, it must be created with certain data formats. The formats used for
depth/stencil buffering are as follows:

1. DXGI_FORMAT_D32_FLOAT_S8X24_UINT: Specifies a 32-bit floating-point depth buffer, with 8-bits (unsigned integer) reserved
for the stencil buffer mapped to the [0, 255] range and 24-bits not used for padding.

2. DXGI_FORMAT_D24_UNORM_S8_UINT: Specifies an unsigned 24-bit depth buffer mapped to the [0, 1] range with 8-bits (unsigned
integer) reserved for the stencil buffer mapped to the [0, 255] range.

In our D3DApp framework, when we create the depth buffer, we specify:
	DXGI_FORMAT mDepthStencilFormat = DXGI_FORMAT_D24_UNORM_S8_UINT;
	depthStencilDesc.Format = mDepthStencilFormat;

Also, the stencil buffer should be reset to some value at the beginning of each frame. This is done with the void
ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::ClearDepthStencilView method (which also clears the depth buffer).

The decision to block a particular pixel from being written is decided by the stencil test, which is given by the following:

if(StencilRef & StencilReadMask < Value & StencilReadMask)
	accept pixel
else
	reject pixel

The stencil test is performed as pixels get rasterized (i.e., during the outputmerger stage), assuming stenciling is enabled,
and takes two operands:

1. A left-hand-side (LHS) operand that is determined by ANDing an application-defined stencil reference value (StencilRef) with
an application-defined masking value (StencilReadMask).

2. A right-hand-side (RHS) operand that is determined by ANDing the entry already in the stencil buffer of the particular pixel
we are testing (Value) with an application-defined masking value (StencilReadMask).

Note that the StencilReadMask is the same for the LHS and the RHS. The stencil test then compares the LHS with the RHS as
specified an application-chosen comparison function <, which returns a true or false value. We write the pixel to the back
buffer if the test evaluates to true (assuming the depth test also passes). If the test evaluates to false, then we block the
pixel from being written to the back buffer. And of course, if a pixel is rejected due to failing the stencil test, it is not
written to the depth buffer either.

The < operator is any one of the functions defined in the D3D12_COMPARISON_FUNC enumerated type:

1. D3D12_COMPARISON_NEVER: The function always returns false.
2. D3D12_COMPARISON_LESS: Replace < with the < operator.
3. D3D12_COMPARISON_EQUAL: Replace < with the == operator.
4. D3D12_COMPARISON_LESS_EQUAL: Replace < with the <= operator.
5. D3D12_COMPARISON_GREATER: Replace < with the > operator.
6. D3D12_COMPARISON_NOT_EQUAL: Replace < with the != operator.
7. D3D12_COMPARISON_GREATER_EQUAL: Replace < with the >= operator.
8. D3D12_COMPARISON_ALWAYS: The function always returns true.

Depth Settings

1. DepthEnable: Specify true to enable the depth buffering; specify false to disable it. When depth testing is disabled, the
draw order matters, and a pixel fragment will be drawn even if it is behind an occluding object. If depth buffering is
disabled, elements in the depth buffer are not updated either, regardless of the DepthWriteMask setting.

2. DepthWriteMask: This can be either D3D12_DEPTH_WRITE_MASK_ZERO or D3D12_DEPTH_WRITE_MASK_ALL, but not both. Assuming
DepthEnable is set to true, D3D12_DEPTH_WRITE_MASK_ZERO disables writes to the depth buffer, but depth testing will still
occur. D3D12_DEPTH_WRITE_MASK_ALL enables writes to the depth buffer; new depths will be written provided the depth and stencil
test both pass. The ability to control depth reads and writes becomes necessary for implementing certain special effects.

3. DepthFunc: Specify one of the members of the D3D12_COMPARISON_FUNC enumerated type to define the depth test comparison
function. Usually this is always D3D12_COMPARISON_LESS so that the usual depth test is performed. That is, a pixel fragment is
accepted provided its depth value is less than the depth of the previous pixel written to the back buffer. But as you can see,
Direct3D allows you to customize the depth test if necessary.

Stencil Settings

1. StencilEnable: Specify true to enable the stencil test; specify false to disable it.

2. StencilReadMask: The StencilReadMask used in the stencil test:
if(StencilRef & StencilReadMask < Value & StencilReadMask)
	accept pixel
else
	reject pixel

The default does not mask any bits: #define D3D12_DEFAULT_STENCIL_READ_MASK (0xff)

3. StencilWriteMask: When the stencil buffer is being updated, we can mask off certain bits from being written to with the
write mask. For example, if you wanted to prevent the top 4 bits from being written to, you could use the write mask of 0x0f.
The default value does not mask any bits: #define D3D12_DEFAULT_STENCIL_WRITE_MASK ( 0xff )

triangles.

5. BackFace: A filled out D3D12_DEPTH_STENCILOP_DESC structure indicating how the stencil buffer works for back facing
triangles.

typedef struct D3D12_DEPTH_STENCILOP_DESC {
 D3D12_STENCIL_OP StencilFailOp; // Default: D3D12_STENCIL_OP_KEEP
 D3D12_STENCIL_OP StencilDepthFailOp; // Default: D3D12_STENCIL_OP_KEEP

} D3D12_DEPTH_STENCILOP_DESC;

1. StencilFailOp: A member of the D3D12_STENCIL_OP enumerated type describing how the stencil buffer should be updated when the
stencil test fails for a pixel fragment.

2. StencilDepthFailOp: A member of the D3D12_STENCIL_OP enumerated type describing how the stencil buffer should be updated
when the stencil test passes but the depth test fails for a pixel fragment.

3. StencilPassOp: A member of the D3D12_STENCIL_OP enumerated type describing how the stencil buffer should be updated when the
stencil test and depth test both pass for a pixel fragment.

4. StencilFunc: A member of the D3D12_COMPARISON_FUNC enumerated type to define the stencil test comparison function.

typedef enum D3D12_STENCIL_OP
{
 D3D12_STENCIL_OP_KEEP = 1,
 D3D12_STENCIL_OP_ZERO = 2,
 D3D12_STENCIL_OP_REPLACE = 3,
 D3D12_STENCIL_OP_INCR_SAT = 4,
 D3D12_STENCIL_OP_DECR_SAT = 5,
 D3D12_STENCIL_OP_INVERT = 6,
 D3D12_STENCIL_OP_INCR = 7,
 D3D12_STENCIL_OP_DECR = 8
} D3D12_STENCIL_OP;

1. D3D12_STENCIL_OP_KEEP: Specifies to not change the stencil buffer; that is, keep the value currently there.

2. D3D12_STENCIL_OP_ZERO: Specifies to set the stencil buffer entry to zero.

3. D3D12_STENCIL_OP_REPLACE: Specifies to replaces the stencil buffer entry with the stencil-reference value (StencilRef) used
in the stencil test. Note that the StencilRef value is set when we bind the depth/stencil state block to the rendering pipeline.

4. D3D12_STENCIL_OP_INCR_SAT: Specifies to increment the stencil buffer entry. If the incremented value exceeds the maximum
value (e.g., 255 for an 8-bit stencil buffer), then we clamp the entry to that maximum.

5. D3D12_STENCIL_OP_DECR_SAT: Specifies to decrement the stencil buffer entry. If the decremented value is less than zero, then
we clamp the entry to zero.

6. D3D12_STENCIL_OP_INVERT: Specifies to invert the bits of the stencil buffer entry.

7. D3D12_STENCIL_OP_INCR: Specifies to increment the stencil buffer entry. If the incremented value exceeds the maximum value
(e.g., 255 for an 8-bit stencil buffer), then we wrap to 0.

8. D3D12_STENCIL_OP_DECR: Specifies to decrement the stencil buffer entry. If the decremented values is less than zero, then we
wrap to the maximum allowed value.

The stencil reference value is set with the ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::OMSetStencilRef method, which takes a single unsigned
integer parameter; for example, the following sets the stencil reference value to 1: mCommandList->OMSetStencilRef(1);

Implementing mirrors programmatically requires us to solve two problems. First, we must learn how to reflect an object about an
arbitrary plane so that we can draw the reflection correctly. Second, we must only display the reflection in a mirror, that is,
we must somehow "mark" a surface as a mirror and then, as we are rendering, only draw the refl ected object if it is in a
mirror.

To draw a reflection of an object, we just need to reflect it over the mirror plane. However, this introduces a problem. For
example, the reflection of the object (the skull in this case) is just another object in our scene, and if nothing is occluding
it, then the eye will see it. However, the reflection should only be seen through the mirror. We can solve this problem using
the stencil buffer because the stencil buffer allows us to block rendering to certain areas on the back buffer. Thus we can use
the stencil buffer to block the rendering of the reflected skull if it is not being rendered into the mirror.

The following outlines the step of how this can be accomplished:

1. Render the floor, walls, and skull to the back buffer as normal (but not the mirror). Note that this step does not modify
the stencil buffer.

2. Clear the stencil buffer to 0.

3. Render the mirror only to the stencil buffer. We can disable color writes to the back buffer by creating a blend state that
sets D3D12_RENDER_TARGET_BLEND_DESC::RenderTargetWriteMask = 0; and we can disable writes to the depth buffer by setting
D3D12_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC::DepthWriteMask = D3D12_DEPTH_WRITE_MASK_ZERO;

When rendering the mirror to the stencil buffer, we set the stencil test to always succeed (D3D12_COMPARISON_ALWAYS) and
specify that the stencil buffer entry should be replaced (D3D12_STENCIL_OP_REPLACE) with 1 (StencilRef) if the test passes. If
the depth test fails, we specify D3D12_STENCIL_OP_KEEP so that the stencil buffer is not changed if the depth test fails (this
can happen, for example, if the skull obscures part of the mirror). Since we are only rendering the mirror to the stencil
buffer, it follows that all the pixels in the stencil buffer will be 0 except for the pixels that correspond to the visible
part of the mirror—they will have a value of 1.

It is important to draw the mirror to the stencil buffer after we have drawn the skull so that pixels of the mirror occluded by
the skull fail the depth test, and thus do not modify the stencil buffer. We do not want to turn on parts of the stencil buffer
that are occluded; otherwise the reflection will show through the skull.

For example in Figure 11.4, Rendering the mirror to the stencil buffer, essentially marking the pixels in the stencil buffer
that correspond to the visible parts of the mirror. The solid black area on the stencil buffer denotes stencil entries set to
1. Note that the area on the stencil buffer occluded by the box does not get set to 1 since it fails the depth test (the box
is in front of that part of the mirror).

4. Now we render the reflected skull to the back buffer and stencil buffer. But recall that we only will render to the back
buffer if the stencil test passes. This time, we set the stencil test to only succeed if the value in the stencil buffer
equals 1; this is done using a StencilRef of 1, and the stencil operator D3D12_COMPARISON_EQUAL. In this way, the reflected
skull will only be rendered to areas that have a 1 in their corresponding stencil buffer entry. Since the areas in the stencil
buffer that correspond to the visible parts of the mirror are the only entries that have a 1, it follows that the reflected
skull will only be rendered into the visible parts of the mirror.

5. Finally, we render the mirror to the back buffer as normal. However, in order for the skull reflection to show through
(which lies behind the mirror), we need to render the mirror with transparency blending. If we did not render the mirror with
transparency, the mirror would simply occlude the reflection since its depth is less than that of the reflection. To implement
this, we simply need to define a new material instance for the mirror; we set the alpha channel of the diffuse component to 0.3
to make the mirror 30% opaque, and we render the mirror with the transparency blend state.

Assuming we have laid down the reflected skull pixels to the back buffer, we see 30% of the color comes from the mirror
(source) and 70% of the color comes from the skull (destination).

To implement the previously described algorithm, we need two PSOs. The first is used when drawing the mirror to mark the mirror
pixels on the stencil buffer. The second is used to draw the reflected skull so that it is only drawn into the visible parts of
the mirror.

Shadows aid in our perception of where light is being emitted in a scene and ultimately makes the scene more realistic. Planar
shadows are shadows that lie on a plane.

To implement planar shadows, we must first find the shadow an object casts to a plane and model it geometrically so that we can
render it. This can easily be done with some 3D math. We then render the triangles that describe the shadow with a black
material at 50% transparency. Rendering the shadow like this can introduce some rendering artifacts called "double blending",
we utilize the stencil buffer to prevent double blending from occurring.

Given a parallel light source with direction L, the light ray that passes through a vertex p is given by r(t) = p + tL. The
intersection of the ray r(t) with the shadow plane (n, d) gives s. The set of intersection points found by shooting a ray
through each of the object’s vertices with the plane defines the projected geometry of the shadow.

For a vertex p, its shadow projection is given by: s = r(ts) = p - (n * p + d / n * L) * L

To use the shadow matrix, we combine it with our world matrix. However, after the world transform, the geometry has not really
been projected on to the shadow plane yet because the perspective divide has not occurred yet. A problem arises if
sw = n·L < 0. because this makes the w-coordinate negative.

Notice that L serves different purposes for point and parallel lights. For point lights we use L to define the position of the
point light. For parallel lights we use L to define the direction towards the infinitely far away light source (i.e., the
opposite direction the parallel light rays travel).

The first time we render a shadow pixel, the stencil test will pass because the stencil buffer entry is 0. However, when we
render this pixel, we also increment the corresponding stencil buffer entry to 1. Thus, if we attempt to overwrite to an area
that has already been rendered to (marked in the stencil buffer with a value of 1), the stencil test will fail. This prevents
drawing over the same pixel more than once, and thus prevents double blending.
