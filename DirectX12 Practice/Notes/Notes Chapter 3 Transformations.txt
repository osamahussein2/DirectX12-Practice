A linear transformation can consist of input and output values other than 3D vectors.

The vectors i = (1, 0, 0), j = (0, 1, 0), and k = (0, 0, 1), which are unit vectors that aim along the working coordinate
axes, respectively, are called the standard basis vectors for R^3. (R^3 denotes the set of all 3D coordinate vectors (x, y, z)).

Scaling refers to changing the size of an object.

However, translation does not make sense for vectors because a vector only describes direction and magnitude, independent of
location; in other words, vectors should be unchanged under translations. Translations should only be applied to points (i.e.,
position vectors).

Homogeneous coordinates provide a convenient notational mechanism that enables us to handle points and vectors uniformly. With
homogeneous coordinates, we augment to 4-tuples and what we place in the fourth w-coordinate depends on whether we are
describing a point or vector. Specifically, we write:

1. (x, y, z, 0) for vectors
2. (x, y, z, 1) for points

We will see later that setting w = 1 for points allows translations of points to work correctly, and setting w = 0 for vectors
prevents the coordinates of vectors from being modified by translations (we do not want to translate the coordinates of a 
vector, as that would change its direction and magnitude—translations should not alter the properties of vectors).

To review so far, the vector and point change of coordinate transformations are:
(x', y', z') = x*uB + y*vB + z*wB for vectors
(x', y', z') = x*uB + y*vB + z*wB + QB for points

If we use homogeneous coordinates, then we can handle vectors and points by one equation:
(x', y', z', w) = x*uB + y*vB + z*wB + w*QB

If w = 0, then this equation reduces to the change of coordinate transformation for vectors; if w = 1, then this equation
reduces to the change of coordinate transformation for points.

For DirectX Math functions, XMVector3TransformCoord and XMVector3TransformNormal, you do not need to explicitly set the w
coordinate. The functions will always use vw = 1 and vw = 0 for XMVector3TransformCoord and XMVector3TransformNormal,
respectively.
